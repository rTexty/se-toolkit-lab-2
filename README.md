# Lab 01 – Products, Architecture & Roles

To kickstart the course, you will explore two things:
>
> 1) How real software products are structured;
> 2) What kind of engineers build and operate them.
>
## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab you should be able to:

- Use GitHub to structure your work and collaborate with peers (issues, branches, pull requests, and reviews).
- Explain the basic architecture of a real-world digital product in terms of components, data flow, and deployment.
- Reflect on your career in tech, examine your current skillset, and plan for the future.

## Tasks overview

To complete this lab, you will need to:

- Set up your `GitHub` account and this lab's repo.
- Pick an existing digital product.
- Sketch its architecture: components, data flow, deployment.
- Map components to tech roles and skills using real job postings and `roadmap.sh`.
- Practice using GitHub issues, branches and pull requests (PRs) to organize your work in a repository (repo) and get feedback from peers.

This and all other lab assignments will simulate real-life engineering practices:

- Follow processes;
- Communicate via issues/PRs;
- Keep the work reviewable;
- Write acceptance criteria;
- Write clear commit messages.

## Repo structure

- [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml) - an issue form for a task.
- [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](./.github/pull_request_template.md) - a template for PRs.
- [`./docs/diagrams`](./docs/diagrams) - diagrams of the product's architecture.
- [`./.vscode/settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json) - `VS Code` settings.
- [`./.vscode/extensions.json`](./.vscode/extensions.json) - recommended `VS Code` extensions.

## Submission checklist

By the end of the lab:

- Make sure that each task that you have completed has a corresponding issue linked to a PR.
- Close the issues for which all related activities are done.
- Show your progress to the TA as your proceed with the lab. TA will share a link to the table to mark the status of your tasks.

---

## Procedure for each task

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure is based on the [`GitHub flow`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) a `GitHub` issue in your forked repo using the `Lab Task` [issue form](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms).
2. Create a new branch for the issue via [`GitHub`](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) or via `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
3. <details><summary> Make <a href="https://smartprogramming.in/tutorials/git-and-github/git-commit">commits</a> to that branch to complete the task (click to expand).</summary>

     - Commit messages must follow the [`Conventional Commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
     - Commit to the branch using one of these approaches:
       1. Using `VS Code` (see [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/staging-commits)): `Activity Bar` -> `Source Control` -> Click a file -> Select lines in the editor -> Right mouse click the selected lines -> Click `Stage Selected Ranges` -> Write a commit message -> Click `Commit`.
       2. Using a terminal (adds all changes in these files to the staging area):

          ```console
          git add <file 1> <file 2> ... <file n>
          git commit -m "<message>"
          ```

   </details>

4. Push the branch to your forked repo:

    ```console
    git push -u origin <branch-name>
    ```

5. Create a PR to the `main` branch via [`GitHub`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) ([tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git/creating-a-pull-request-on-any-public-repository-from-github-using-vs-code/)) or via the [`GitHub Pull Requests` extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github#_pull-requests).
6. Write an appropriate PR description following the PR template.
7. [Link the PR](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) to the issue, e.g. `Closes #<issue number>`.
8. [Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review#requesting-reviews-from-collaborators-and-organization-members) a review of the PR from the collaborator.
9. Get the collaborator comments and address them, e.g., make fixes or ask to clarify the comment.
10. Get the collaborator to approve the PR.
11. Merge the PR to the `main` branch.
12. Close the issue.
13. Delete the branch.

## PR reviews

As a PR reviewer, you must:

- Review the assigned PR and leave at least 2 meaningful comments created for [particular lines](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-comments-to-a-pull-request).
- Approve the PR if you're satisfied with the PR.

As a PR author, you must:

- Reply to comments in a meaningful way, e.g., write “Fixed in d0d5aeb” (`d0d5aeb` being the id of commit where you addressed the comment), ask to clarify the comment, or explain why you disagree.
- Make necessary changes based on the review.

6. [ ] In that roadmap, mark the items you already have at least some knowledge in.
7. [ ] In `./docs/roles-and-skills.md`, in the `## My chosen role` section, write:

    ```markdown
    ### Role
    
    <name>
    
    ### Skills I already have
    <!-- from roadmap.sh -->
    - ...
    
    ### Skills I clearly lack
    <!-- from roadmap.sh, 8-10 skills -->
    - ...
    ```

8. [ ] Find **5-7 job postings** for this role on [`HH.ru`](https://hh.ru) or a similar job site.
9. [ ] For each posting, list:

    <!-- 3-10 skills -->
    - ...
    
    ### Skills from postings that I haven't yet seen on roadmap.sh
    <!-- 1-5 skills -->
    - ...
    
    ### My key takeaway
    ...
    ```

---

### 3. Short personal reflection

1. [ ] Create the issue `[Task] Personal reflection`.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Write this section **without** an LLM. It’s about your own thoughts.

2. [ ] In `./docs/reflection.md` write 5–10 sentences answering:
    - [ ] Which role did you choose and why?
    - [ ] What is one thing about the product’s architecture that was new to you?
    - [ ] Which course topics (`Git`, `Linux`, `Docker`, `REST`, `CI/CD`, full-stack development, data processing) seem most relevant to your chosen role?
    - [ ] What is one concrete skill you would like to improve this semester?

        - [ ] technical constraints;
        - [ ] primary functional requirements;
        - [ ] quality requirements.
        - [ ] architectural concerns.
    - [ ] In the `## Design decisions` section:

      - [ ] Link each decision to an architectural driver.
      - [ ] Justify each decision (provide rationale) in 1-2 sentences.
      - [ ] List 1-2 discarded alternatives for each decision.

3. [ ] Update the architecture diagrams to match your design decisions.

### 5. (Optional) Work on an agent

1. Create the issue `[Task] Work on an agent`.

## Appendix

### Architectural views

#### Component diagram

This is a *static view* of the architecture. It doesn't show how the system works, but rather what components it has and how they are connected.

We use `PlantUML` [component diagrams](https://plantuml.com/component-diagram).

"Balls" (circle) are *provided interfaces*, "sockets" (open ring) are *required interfaces* (see [explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78941132), [how to draw them](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55077828/using-required-provided-interfaces-in-component-diagrams-plantuml/57134601#57134601)).

Learn more about the component diagrams on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_diagram).

#### Sequence diagram

This is a *dynamic view* of the architecture. It shows how the system works by showing the sequence of interactions between components.

We use `PlantUML` [sequence diagrams](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram).

[`Mermaid`](#visualize-the-architecture---mermaid) also [supports](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html) sequence diagrams.

Learn more about the sequence diagrams on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram).

#### Deployment diagram

This is a *static view* of the architecture. It shows how the system is deployed, i.e., what hardware and software components are used and how they are connected.

We use `PlantUML` [deployment diagrams](https://plantuml.com/deployment-diagram).

[`Mermaid`](#visualize-the-architecture---mermaid) supports [Architecture](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/architecture.html) diagrams and [C4](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/c4.html#c4-deployment-diagram-c4deployment) deployment diagrams.

Some [other tools](#visualize-the-architecture---other-tools) also support deployment diagrams.

Learn more about the deployment diagrams on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_diagram).

### Visualize the architecture

<!-- TODO update wording -->

> [!NOTE]
> Visualizing the architecture is not the same as designing the architecture.
>
> To design the architecture of a system, you need to consider the architectural drivers. This approach is outlined in the optional [Task 4](#4-optional-update-architecture).

#### Visualize the architecture - `Draw.io`

You can *prototype* diagrams in `./docs/diagrams/prototype` via the [`hediet.vscode-drawio`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) extension ([example](./docs/diagrams/prototype/example.drawio.svg)).

However, it's not a good idea to version control images because you can't conveniently visualize their diffs and therefore can't track changes well.

Therefore, you must use the ["diagrams as code"](https://simmering.dev/blog/diagrams/) approach and eventually switch to one of the following approaches.

#### Visualize the architecture - `PlantUML`

[`PlantUML`](https://plantuml.com/) supports all the diagrams we need. Therefore, we use it to visualize the architecture.

If you want to preview the `PlantUML` diagrams in `VS Code`, follow these steps:

- [ ] Install the [`jebbs.plantuml`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) `VS Code` extension.
- [ ] Install [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).
- [ ] Run in the terminal `docker run --name plantuml-server -d -p 48080:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty` to start a `PlantUML` server.
- [ ] Open the `PlantUML` server in the browser at `http://localhost:48080` to make sure it works.
- [ ] In `VS Code`, in the `./docs/diagrams/src/` directory, open a `PlantUML` file with the `.puml` extension.
- [ ] Click the `Preview Current Diagram` icon.

    The extension should connect to the `PlantUML` server and render the diagram.

    The `48080` port is already set in [`./.vscode/settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json).

- [ ] Write the `PlantUML` code in `./docs/diagrams/src/` and render the diagrams to `SVG` in `./docs/diagrams/out/` using the `jebbs.plantuml` extension. These directories are already set in [`./.vscode/settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json)..
- [ ] To render diagrams to SVG, open the [`Command Palette`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette), write `PlantUML: Export Workspace Diagrams`, and choose `svg`.
- [ ] [Embed](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) the rendered images into your `Markdown` file.

#### Visualize the architecture - `Mermaid`

You can write [`Mermaid`](https://mermaid.js.org/) code in `Markdown` files in code blocks with the `mermaid` language tag (see [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams#creating-mermaid-diagrams)).

#### Visualize the architecture - other tools

Other tools that implement the "diagrams as code" approach are:

- [`Structurizr`](https://structurizr.com/)
- [`D2`](https://d2lang.com/)
- [`LikeC4`](https://github.com/likec4/likec4) etc.
